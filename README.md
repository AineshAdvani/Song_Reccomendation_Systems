# Song_Reccomendation_Systems
A recommendation system that recommends songs to user based on the lyrics of their liked songs

## Description

In this project, I attempted to implement a Content-Based Filtering Music Recommendation System using K-Means Clustering to process song lyrics with their Term-Frequency values. 

### Big Picture
1. Use Term/word Frequency to handle songâ€™s lyrics
2. Cluster songs with similarities in lyrics and meaning together
3. Recommend multiple songs with highest lyric similarity.
